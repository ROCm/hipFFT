# Change log for hipFFT

Partial documentation for hipFFT is available at [hipFFT].

## hipFFT 1.0.8 for ROCm 5.2.0

### Added
- Added File/Folder Reorg Changes with backward compatibility support using ROCM-CMAKE wrapper functions.
- Packages for test and benchmark executables on all supported OSes using CPack.

## hipFFT 1.0.7 for ROCm 5.1.0

### Changed

- Use fft_params struct for accuracy and benchmark clients.

## hipFFT 1.0.6 for ROCm 5.0.0

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect reporting of rocFFT version.

### Changed

- Unconditionally enabled callback functionality.  On the CUDA backend, callbacks only run

## hipFFT 1.0.5 for ROCm 4.5.0

### Added

- Added support for Windows 10 as a build target.

### Changed

- Packaging split into a runtime package called hipfft and a development package called hipfft-devel.
  The development package depends on runtime. The runtime package suggests the development package
